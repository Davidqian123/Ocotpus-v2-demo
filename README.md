# Android ChatBot with Octopus v2

This project is an Android-based chatbot application that utilizes the Octopus v2 for generating responses. It is built upon the foundation of the [Android-ChatBot](https://github.com/gangulwar/Android-ChatBot) repository.

## Features

- Android-based chat interface
- Integration with the Octopus v2 model
- HTTP requests for retrieving model outputs

## How It Works

This application extends the original Android-ChatBot project by incorporating the Octopus model for more advanced language processing capabilities. The app sends user input to the Octopus model via HTTP requests and displays the generated responses in the chat interface.
