# Android ChatBot with Octopus v2 - Function Calling Demo

This project is an Android-based chatbot application that showcases the capabilities of Octopus v2 in understanding natural language to determine which functions to call and what parameters to use. This demo app implements several functionalities to demonstrate the effectiveness of Octopus v2 in an Android environment.

## Features

- Android-based chat interface
- Integration with the Octopus v2 model
- Natural language processing for function calling and parameter determination
- HTTP requests for retrieving model outputs
- Demo functionalities to showcase Octopus v2's capabilities

## How It Works

This application extends the original Android-ChatBot project by incorporating the Octopus v2 model. The app processes user input to intelligently decide which functions to call and what parameters to use, demonstrating advanced language understanding. It sends these decisions to the Octopus model via HTTP requests and displays the generated responses in the chat interface.

## Demo Purpose

This app is designed as a demonstration to showcase the potential of Octopus v2 in Android applications. The implemented functionalities serve as examples of how natural language can be used to interact with various app features.
